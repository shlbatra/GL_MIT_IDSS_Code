Note - I have tested the below steps while installing MiniConda on Windows10 on my user environment. 

The commands below are run on Command Prompt 

1. Create Virtual Environment on cmd -

conda create --name py_mitidss python=3.9 

py_mitidss is the name of the virtual environment. Feel free to rename the virtual environment as required. 

2. List all Virtual Environments on your system 

conda env list

3. Activate your Virtual Environment 

conda activate py_mitidss

4. See list of packages installed 

pip list

5. Install following packages to run Jupyter Notebook from Virtual Environment

pip install notebook

6. Run any other packages you require on the notebook such as 

pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib seaborn

7. Run Jupyter notebook by giving the command below -
